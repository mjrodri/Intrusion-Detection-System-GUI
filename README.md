# Intrusion-Detection-System-GUI

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with GUI
This Python project implements a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The IDS monitors network traffic and logs details of TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. Please note that this code requires the Scapy library for packet sniffing, and it is recommended to have WinPcap installed for full functionality.

# Prerequisites
Python
Scapy library (pip install scapy)
WinPcap (for Windows users)

# How to Use
Install the required libraries by running pip install scapy.
If you are using Windows, make sure to install WinPcap.
Run the provided Python script.
Use the "Start IDS" button to initiate packet sniffing and monitor network traffic.
View real-time packet details in the GUI.
Press the "Stop IDS" button to halt packet sniffing.
Note: Ensure that the script is executed with sufficient permissions for packet sniffing.

Feel free to contribute or customize the code to meet specific requirements. For further information on Scapy and WinPcap, refer to their respective documentation.
